# Reproducible Analytical Pipelines Minimum Viable Product Guidance (RAP MVP)

## Things to be aware of

This guidance has been agreed upon by a working group of the [Reproducible Analytical Pipelines Champion](https://gss.civilservice.gov.uk/about-us/champion-networks/reproducible-analytical-pipeline-rap-champions/).
It will be reviewed periodically by the RAP Champions and the Best Practice and Impact data science team.

Your department may have standards that you have to work to when it comes to writing code or developing analytical products.
This guidance is a general set of advice and guidelines for any and all analytical pipelines.
Producers of analysis may incorporate some or all of these guidelines into their work depending on their needs and users.

## Introduction

### Reproducible analytical pipelines are a guarantee for users and producers

In the future, analytical processes should be reproducible to a proportionate level.
They must be backed up by a clear history of analytical decisions and implementation.
Good quality assurance processes will help to identify errors or upstream changes quicker.
Working in the open, these reproducible analytical pipelines will guarantee to users and producers alike that the analysis is trustworthy, high-quality and efficient.

### Who is this guidance for?

This guidance is for official statisticians and analysts working in the UK government.
This guidance may also be helpful for users of official statistics.

### Lessons learned in software engineering can be translated to official statistics and analysis

For producers, processes for analysis have often been constrained by inappropriate, proprietary software that makes them inefficient and quality assurance difficult.
This has caused frustration for producers and their managers as quality issues recur and analysis becomes resource-intensive.
Developing software using some best practices from software engineering helps to alleviate this.
Automated testing reports how the pipeline is performing and good error handling prevents failures from impacting outputs.
Use of version control software 

Users must trust the processes by which government analysis, research and statistics are produced.
Trust is diminished where processes are not transparent or produce low quality outputs.
When analysts and reserachers work in the open they increase transparency about both how the analysis is produced and to what degree of quality.
